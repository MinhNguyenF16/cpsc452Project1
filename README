Programming language used: C++
====================================================
Description: This program is used to encrypt and decrypt messages for several different ciphers
====================================================
Program instructions:
1. To compile, simply, type "make" at the terminal (without the quotes).
2. To execute, type in the ternimal this formar: ./cipher <CIPHER NAME> <KEY> <ENC/DEC> <INPUTFILE> <OUTPUT FILE>
Example: ./cipher PLF goodmorning ENC file1.txt file1.txt

Available cipher names:
				– PLF: Playfair
				– RTS: Row Transposition
				– RFC: Railfence
				– VIG: Vigenre
				– CES: Caesar
				– HIL: Hill

Cipher key formats:
				– PLF: String of regular letters. Ex: kingdom...
				– RTS: Separated by (,) integers. Ex: 5,2,1,3,4
				– RFC: An integer. Ex: 4\n"<<
				– VIG: String of regular letters. Ex: security...
				– CES: An integer 1-25. Ex: 7
				– HIL: 4 integers separated by (,). Ex: 3,4,9,7...

File "y1.txt" provided for testing.
Try this to start testing the program:
This line will use playfair cipher with "goodmorning" key to encrypt the message in file y1.txt and output to y2.txt
./cipher PLF goodmorning ENC y1.txt y2.txt

====================================================
Extra Credit: Attempted, cipher name is "HIL"
Note:
-Hill cipher is limited to 2x2 key matrix because I don't have enough time to implement a decryption for 3x3 and larger matrices because lack of time to implement a more complex matrix inverse
